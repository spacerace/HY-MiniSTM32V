## HY-MiniSTM32V project examples

This archive includes a few example projects for the **HY-MiniSTM32V board**.
This board ships with some Keil Examples which are very buggy and mostly
unusable.
The examples in this archive are all IDE-independet, they use gcc and Makefiles.

### Included Example Projects:
	* USART1 with/without printf
	* I2C1 with PCF8574
	* CPU temperature reading via ADC
	* CRC calculation
	* CRC engine emulation in C
	* EXTI, Buttons, LEDs
	* SysTick Interrupt, Delay-Routine
